# Diamond_Price_Prediction
## Introduction
In here, I've predicted the price of the diamond basing on cut, clarity, color, depth, table, carat, length, width and height of the diamond.
## Predictors 
Carat:- Carat weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01) 

Cut:- Describe cut quality of the diamond. Quality in increasing order Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal 
Color:- Color of the diamond, with D being the best and J the worst 
Clarity:- How obvious inclusions are within the diamond:(in order from best to worst, FL = flawless, I3= level 3 inclusions) FL,IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1, I2, I3 
Depth:- The height of a diamond, measured from the culet to the table, divided by its average girdle diameter. 
Table:- The width of the diamond's table expressed as a percentage of its average diameter 
x:- Length mm (0mm--10.74mm) 
y:- Width mm (0mm--58.9mm) 
z:- Depth mm (0mm--31.8mm) 
price:- the price of the diamond ($326-$18,823)
